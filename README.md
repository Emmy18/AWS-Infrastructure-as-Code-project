# AWS-Infrastructure-as-Code-project

In this project, I deployed web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. Using AWS Cloudformation, I wrote the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for simple web page. I began with deploying the networking components, followed by servers, security roles and software. 

The web page files are automatically retreived from an S3 bucket which a created in the AWS Cloud console.
